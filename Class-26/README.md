The key here is quality, don’t skimp on the ingredients. Buy the highest quality ingredients you can afford, trust me it will be worth it. It will still turn out a lot cheaper than buying a takeaway. What’s more, it will be a million times better!

Many people think of a margherita as being boring but when made with love and good ingredients, this is one the best pizzas there is.

The tomato sauce gives a wonderful rich flavour with a hint of acidity, the mozzarella provides a creaminess with a pillowy soft texture, the parmesan adds a subtle sharpness and saltiness, the basil gives a hint of herbiness, the olive oil gives a luxurious oily flavour that coats the mouth, and the black pepper gives it a little kick.

Whilst it may seem basic, all the ingredients have been carefully selected. They all compliment each other so well. It is important that the ingredients are added in the right quantities so that they all balance each other.
